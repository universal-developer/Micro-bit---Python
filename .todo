Set everything up so:

If the user clicks on the right button - I will add one pixel of the light
Elif the user clicks on the left button - I will remove one pixel of the light

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything will be controled by gyroscope like: 
    1. If the user turns the chip on the right, lights are going to the right corner
        ----- exception: if there are no place to go to the right then a sound will play
    2. If the user turns the chip on the left, lights are going to the left corner
        ----- exception: if there are no place to go to the left then a sound will play
        !!!! simple solution: add counter var which -= 1 and += 1
    3. If the user decides to turn the chip on the top, lights are going to the top 
        ----- exception; if there are no place to go to the top, the a sound will play
    4. If the user decides to turn the chip on the bottom, lights are going to the bottom
        ----- exception; if there are no place to go to the bottom, the a sound will play
        !!!! simple solution: add counter var which -= 1 and += 1
